**PCOS Detection Using Machine Learning**
Project Overview
This project aims to develop an intelligent system for detecting Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) from ultrasound images using Machine Learning techniques. The system is based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image feature extraction, coupled with an ensemble learning model for classification.

PCOS is a hormonal disorder that affects women’s reproductive health, often leading to infertility due to the formation of cysts in the ovaries. Early and accurate diagnosis is critical for effective treatment and symptom management. This project offers a computer-aided solution to identify PCOS from ovary ultrasound images, improving diagnostic accuracy and reducing manual errors.

Features
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for automated feature extraction from ultrasound images.
Transfer Learning techniques applied for improved model accuracy.
Stacking Ensemble Method with conventional machine learning algorithms (e.g., SVM, Random Forest) to classify PCOS.
User Interface for uploading ultrasound images and receiving diagnostic results.

Getting Started
    Prerequisites
        Python 3.x
        TensorFlow/Keras for deep learning
        OpenCV for image processing
        Pillow for image manipulation
        Tkinter for the GUI
        NumPy and Pandas for data handling


**Model Performance**
The model achieved up to 99% accuracy in classifying PCOS from a test dataset of ultrasound images. The use of CNN and transfer learning significantly improved diagnostic accuracy and reduced training time.

**Future Enhancements**
Extend the model to support multiple imaging modalities such as CT or MRI.
Implement remote PCOS monitoring using mobile health applications or telemedicine.
